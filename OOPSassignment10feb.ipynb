    "Read Mode (\"r\"): This is the default mode for file opening. It allows you to read the contents of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",

    "Write Mode (\"w\"): This mode allows you to write data to a file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. If the file already exists, it will be truncated, erasing its previous contents. Be cautious when using this mode, as it can lead to data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append Mode (\"a\"): This mode is used for appending data to an existing file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. However, unlike write mode, if the file already exists, the new data will be added at the end of the file, preserving its existing contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Mode (\"b\"): This mode is used when dealing with binary files, such as images, audio, or video files. It is often used in conjunction with the other modes, denoted by adding \"b\" to the mode (e.g., \"rb\", \"wb\", \"ab\"). Binary mode ensures that the data is read or written in its binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update Mode (\"+\"): This mode allows both reading and writing to a file. It is denoted by adding \"+\" to the mode (e.g., \"r+\", \"w+\", \"a+\"). In this mode, you can both read from and write to the file, enabling you to modify its contents.\n",
